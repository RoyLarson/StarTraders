Learn Rust by Coding an old Terminal Game

This is a game I used to play. I thought it might be a good one to learn rust.

The information on the original game can be found at  
[Star Traders- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trader)

In particular John Zaitseff has rewritten this game in various formats and has it licensed under GNU which is why there is a GNU license on this repository.  

Please see his page at

for more information.

I am just using this to learn rust and the BASIC program was originally created by Dave Kaufman.
